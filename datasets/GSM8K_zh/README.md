# Dataset

`GSM8K_zh` is a dataset for mathematical reasoning in Chinese, question-answer pairs are translated from GSM8K (https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math/tree/master) by `GPT-3.5-Turbo` with few-shot prompting.
The dataset consists of 7473 training samples and 1319 testing samples. The former is for **supervised fine-tuning**, while the latter is for **evaluation**.

for training samples, `question_zh` and `answer_zh` are question and answer keys, respectively;
for testing samples, only the translated questions are provided (`question_zh`).
