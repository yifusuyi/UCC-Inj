Little A plans to start from $r$ and traverse the entire country for her performance.\n\nSpecifically, let $x$ be Little A's current position, and record a sequence $s$:\n- Initially, $x=r$, $s=[r]$.\n- If $x$ has unvisited children, arbitrarily choose one child $y$, append $y$ to the end of $s$, and move to $y$.\n- If no such $y$ exists: if $x=r$, the performance ends; otherwise, move to $x$'s parent.\n\nWe call the final $s$ obtained as a **traversal method** of $T$, and different choices of children can yield multiple traversal methods. It can be observed that a traversal method is essentially a DFS order of $T$.\n\nLittle A's assistant provides a fee table $\\{w_{n-1}\\}$, and the income $w(T,s)$ of this concert tour can be calculated as follows:\n- For $i\\in[1,n]$, Little A passes through the nodes on the simple path from $s_{i}$ to $s_{i\\bmod n+1}$ in $T$ (**excluding** $s_{i}$ but **including** $s_{i\\bmod n+1}$).\n- Each time she reaches a node, if it's the $i$-th visit, Little A receives $w_i$ coins as payment.\n- $w(T,s)$ is the total number of coins Little A receives.\n\nLittle A's assistant also provides the traversal method $\\{s_n\\}$ for this performance. A tree $T$ is defined as valid if and only if $\\{s_n\\}$ is one of its **traversal methods**. You need to calculate the sum of $w(T,s)$ for all distinct valid $T$, modulo $998244353$.\n\nTwo rooted trees $T$ and $T'$ are considered different if and only if they have different roots or there exists an edge present in $T$ but not in $T'$.", "inputFormat": "**This problem contains multiple test cases.**\n\nThe first line contains a positive integer $T$ representing the number of test cases.

We use $a_{i,j}$ to indicate whether the student with ID $i$ is interested in the $j$-th activity, where $a_{i,j} = 1$ means interested and $a_{i,j} = 0$ means not interested.\n\nFor any two students $i$ and $j$, their number of shared interests is the count of activities $k$ that satisfy $a_{i,k} = a_{j,k} = 1$, i.e., the number of activities both students are interested in.\n\nEach student $x$ will look for the student $y$ with whom they share the most interests and send them a friend invitation. If multiple students $y$ meet the condition, $x$ will send invitations to all of them.\n\nXiao O's student ID is $1$, and he hopes to receive more invitations from his classmates. To achieve this, he can choose one activity he is not interested in (i.e., where $a_{1,i} = 0$) and change it to $a_{1,i} = 1$. Of course, he can also choose not to modify any activity.

Then, Xiao O makes modifications:\n\n- If no modification is made, students $2$ and $3$ will send invitations to each other, and the number of invitations Xiao O receives is $0$.\n- If $a_{1,1}$ is changed to $1$, Xiao O and student $2$ will share $1$ common interest, and student $2$ will send an invitation to Xiao O.

The number of invitations Xiao O receives is $1$.\n- If $a_{1,3}$ is changed to $1$, Xiao O will share $1$ common interest with both other students, and both will send invitations to Xiao O.\n\nThus, the maximum number of students who will send invitations to Xiao O is $2$.\n\n#### Sample #2 Explanation\n\nCompared to Sample #1, there is an additional student with ID $4$, who shares $2$ common interests with students $2$ and $3$. No matter how Xiao O modifies his interests, his shared interests with any classmate will not exceed $1$, so the answer is $0$.\n### Data Range\n\nFor $100\\%$ of the data, $2\\le n\\le 500$, $1\\le m\\le 500$, $0\\le a_{i,j}\\le 1$.\n\nSpecific test case constraints are as follows:\n\n| Test Case ID | Range of $n$ | Range of $m$ | Special Properties |\n| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |\n| $1$ | $n=2$ | $m\\le 50$ | None |\n| $2\\sim 4$ | $n\\le 50$ | $m\\le 50$ | None |\n| $5,6$ | $n\\le 500$ | $m=1$ | A |\n| $7\\sim 10$ | $n\\le 500$ | $m\\le 500$ | A |\n| $11\\sim 14$ | $n\\le 500$ | $m\\le 500$ | B |\n| $15\\sim 20$ | $n\\le 500$ | $m\\le 500$ | None |\n\nSpecial Property A: For $1\\le i\\le m$, $a_{1,i}=0$.\n\nSpecial Property B: For $1\\le i\\le n$, $a_{i,1}=0$.", "limits": {"time": [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000], "memory": [524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288]}, "tags": ["模拟", "洛谷原创", "O2优化", "洛谷月赛"]}

IPv4 uses a 32-bit binary number as an IP address. However, with the rapid increase in the number of network devices, the total number of IPv4 addresses has been exhausted. To solve this problem, computer scientists introduced IPv6.\n\nIPv6 uses a 128-bit binary number as an IP address. For convenience in writing, these 128 bits are often divided into 8 groups, each corresponding to 16 bits. When written, each group is represented as a 4-digit hexadecimal number. Every two groups are separated by a `:`.\n\nThe following figure shows the binary representation of an IPv6 address and its hexadecimal shorthand format.\n\n![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/image_hosting/1symr2e8.png)\n\nHowever, hexadecimal notation is still quite cumbersome. Therefore, IPv6 further introduces shorthand rules for IP addresses:\n\n1. **Leading Zero Omission Rule.** In each group, leading zeros can be omitted. For example, `FC00:0:130F:0:9C0:876A:130B:0` and `FC00:0000:130F:0000:09C0:876A:130B:0000` represent the same address.\n2. **Consecutive Zero Substitution Rule.** If one or more consecutive groups are all zeros, they can be replaced by a double colon `::`. However, the `::` can only be used once in the entire IPv6 address. For example, `2001:DB8:130F::9C0:876A:130B` and `2001:0DB8:130F:0000:0000:09C0:876A:130B` represent the same address. **The `::` can appear at either end of the IPv6 address string.**\n\nNow, given an IPv6 address in hexadecimal format, which **may** have applied the above shorthand rules, please output the corresponding binary format of this IPv6 address.", "inputFormat": "Input one line containing a string representing an IPv6 address in hexadecimal format.", "outputFormat": "Output one line containing 128 digit characters representing the corresponding binary IPv6 address. **Do not** separate the characters with spaces.", "translation": "", "samples": [["1111:2222:3333:0000:0000:0000:7777:FFF\n", "00010001000100010010001000100010001100110011001100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001110111011101110000111111111111"], ["1111:2222:3333::7777:FFFF\n", "00010001000100010010001000100010001100110011001100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001110111011101111111111111111111"]], "hint": "- For 40% of the test cases, the IPv6 address does not apply any shorthand rules;\n- For another 20% of the test cases, the IPv6 address does not apply the consecutive zero substitution rule;\n- For 100% of the test cases, the input is a valid IPv6 address.", "limits": {"time": [1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000], "memory": [524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288, 524288]}, "tags": ["2025", "字符串（入门）", "语言月赛"]}
