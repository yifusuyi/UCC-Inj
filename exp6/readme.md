Here is the experiment for the models' inner feature.

`test_similarity_with_clean_text.py` calucated the cosine similarity between noised text and clean text, while `test_each_prefix.py` calucated the similarity at each word-level prefix between noised and clean text.

## Run commands


```bash
python test_similarity_with_clean_text.py
python test_each_prefix.py
```
