The defining feature of Maimai's arcade cabinet is its striking resemblance to a front-loading washing machine. Early advertisements and promotional materials contained different joke catchphrases, such as 'It's not a washing machine!' and 'No water.' At its first deployment test, Maimai had 'No washing' written on its cabinet. Early in development, the original concept was actually a music player instead of a rhythm game. Up to 2 players can play per cabinet, and up to 4 players can play together with more cabinets. The motherboard can be accessed using the back door on the right side. The original design was revealed to have been made in collaboration with Sharp in Sega's Maimai LIVE 2014 Washing Festival event. Today, fusu was asked a problem by the stuff.
